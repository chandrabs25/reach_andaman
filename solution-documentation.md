# Andaman Explorer Build Issue Resolution

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Property Redefinition Error

**Problem:**
The build process was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: Cannot redefine property: db
```

This occurred in the NextAuth configuration during the build process. The issue was in the `database.ts` file where:
1. A global variable `globalDb` was declared and immediately exported as `db`
2. Later in the file, the code attempted to redefine the `db` property using `Object.defineProperty` when creating a mock database

**Solution:**
Restructured the database initialization and export pattern in `src/lib/database.ts`:
- Moved the mock database initialization before the `db` export
- Removed the problematic `Object.defineProperty` call
- Added the `execute` method to the mock database implementation to match what's being used in the NextAuth route

### 2. Next.js Configuration File Format Issue

**Problem:**
After fixing the first issue, the build process encountered another error:
```
Error: Configuring Next.js via 'next.config.ts' is not supported. Please replace the file with 'next.config.js' or 'next.config.mjs'.
```

**Solution:**
Converted the TypeScript configuration file to JavaScript:
- Created a new `next.config.js` file with the same configuration options
- Used CommonJS module.exports syntax instead of ES module export
- Added JSDoc type annotation for TypeScript support

### 3. Authentication Provider Session Issue

**Problem:**
After fixing the previous issues, the build process encountered another error:
```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'data' of '(0 , l.useSession)(...)' as it is undefined.
```

This occurred in the AuthProvider component where the code was destructuring the result of `useSession()` with `{ data: session, status }`, but this might be undefined during server-side rendering or static generation.

**Solution:**
Modified the `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` file to safely handle cases where the useSession hook might return undefined:
- Removed the destructuring pattern
- Accessed the session data and status more safely with optional chaining
- Added fallback values for when session data is undefined

## Remaining Warnings

The build process now completes successfully but still shows some warnings about dynamic server usage:

```
Error performing search: ex [Error]: Dynamic server usage: Page couldn't be rendered statically because it used `request.url`. See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/dynamic-server-error
```

This is expected behavior for API routes that use request information and is not a critical issue. These routes are correctly marked as dynamic (Î») in the build output.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Database Initialization Pattern**:
   - Consider using a more robust singleton pattern for database initialization
   - Implement proper environment detection for mock database usage

2. **Next.js Configuration**:
   - Always use `.js` or `.mjs` for Next.js configuration files
   - Consider using the official Next.js TypeScript configuration pattern with JSDoc

3. **Authentication Handling**:
   - Implement proper error boundaries around authentication components
   - Add more defensive coding patterns for server-side rendering scenarios
   - Consider using Next.js middleware for authentication to reduce client-side complexity

4. **Static vs Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Review API routes that use request information to determine if they can be made static
   - Use proper Next.js data fetching patterns (getStaticProps, getServerSideProps) where appropriate

5. **Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive tests for authentication flows
   - Implement build verification tests to catch similar issues early

## Build Output Summary

The application now builds successfully with:
- 11 static routes (prerendered as static HTML)
- 17 dynamic routes (server-rendered on demand using Node.js)
- Total First Load JS shared by all: 87.7 kB

This indicates a well-optimized application with a good balance of static and dynamic content.
